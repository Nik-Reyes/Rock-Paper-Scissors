## Rules of the game

- Tool effectiveness

  - Rock beats scissors
  - Paper beats rock
  - Scissors beats paper

- Every time you beat your opponent, you get 1 point

- If you and your opponent choose the same tool, neither player gets a point

- Whoever gets a score of 3 first wins the game, else the game continues
